# Arm-Robot-for-harvesting-Strawberry-Robot
   My work involves designing and creating mechanics. For use in harvesting strawberries in Plant Factory. In order for the mechanical arm to work efficiently, the design must be taken into account. We need to know details about the farm. Height of strawberry planting shelf To analyze and be able to come up with efficient designs.
   As for controlling the arm of my robot, I will use 2 joystick modules to control the arm and the direction of arm rotation, using the PCA9685 board to drive 5 sensors and the A4988 STEPPER MOTOR DRIVER module to Drive 2 motors nema 17 and convert the power from 12 v to 5 v using a dc to dc buck converter to convert the 12 v power used to power the motors nema17 and then convert the power to 5 v to provide power to another 5 servos.
